Description: Create rich and fully interactive timeline visualizations.
    Timelines can be included in Shiny apps and R markdown documents, or viewed
    from the R console and 'RStudio' Viewer. 'timevis' includes an extensive API
    to manipulate a timeline after creation, and supports getting data out of
    the visualization into R. Based on the 'vis.js' Timeline module and the
    'htmlwidgets' R package.
